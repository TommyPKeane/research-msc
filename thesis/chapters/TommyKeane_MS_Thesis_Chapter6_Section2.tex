Again, the work completed here was initially attempting to create a fully automatic panorama creation algorithm from overlapping views of an unknown scene at unknown locations with unknown cameras. While this initial goal cannot be described as being completely met, what has been produced is a novel application of mutual information as a metric in image registration, as it has extended beyond well-defined affine scenarios with large amounts of overlap in well-conditioned views of simple scenes. It is a robust and accurate algorithm for affine views and is an intelligent estimate when extended to projective views of complex, realistic scenes. This work shows the beginnings of extending the known robustness of mutual information as a metric for image and video data correspondence. There are many avenues in which to extend this research that progress in line with modern research as digital imagery is being view more and more as holding extensive amounts of information beyond the reach of basic intensity and gradient calculations.
