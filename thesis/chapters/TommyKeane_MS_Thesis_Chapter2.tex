Before delving into the details of the algorithm and its implementation, it is first necessary to understand some basic and complex mathematical concepts from the fields of random signal theory, information theory, and digital image and video processing. With a robust exploration of the conceptual results of these mathematical and scientific topics, the practical considerations that molded the development of the algorithm will become clear. Even with a deep understanding of the theories to be refreshed here, it was the refracted view of these principles through the lens of the requisite practical considerations that made the algorithm successful.
