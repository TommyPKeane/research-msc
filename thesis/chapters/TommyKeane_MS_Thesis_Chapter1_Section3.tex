The WFMI algorithm is a novel set of means to perform unsupervised, automated panorama creation for surveillance, and other realistic, scenes. The results of the algorithm are convincing, blended views generated by the affine homography derived from the affine transform search between the scenes. This is a robust and novel affine registration algorithm that can be applied to real scene views to provide useful estimations in registering these views of scenes that well beyond the constraints of an affine relationship. The initial implementation of an MMI algorithm gave light to the necessity of incorporating practical considerations in order to successfully utilize mutual information as a robust correspondence metric. The novel weighting and filtering aspects of the WFMI algorithm go beyond a simple normalization process; these steps are actually crucial to getting accurately registered views from realistic scenes or difficult affine scenarios, especially in scenes with lower entropy or minimal amounts of overlap.

There is no camera calibration step, there are no initial correspondences, and there is no camera location or orientation assumption. Obviously if there is no amount of entropy in the views, or no actual overlap, any algorithm would fail. In terms of the WFMI algorithm it was found, as was expected, that minimum tolerable overlap between the views is inversely proportional to the amount of entropy in the overlap regions and in the scenes themselves. These were empirically discovered and while there are no hard-and-fast limits presented here, affine scenes could tolerate down to 1\% overlap while realistic views could tolerate down to 10\% overlap.

By developing a strong understanding of the principles of image registration, this algorithm shows that typical constraints and models can be expanded both mathematically and in practice. Known camera parameters, camera spatial relationships, and \textit{a priori} point correspondences have been clearly shown to be significant aids to getting from two disparate images to a registered panoramic view; but the WFMI algorithm shows that these are not the only means to do so, especially when re-incorporating an understanding of the foundational mathematics and physics of the views and scenes. Practical considerations motivated the generalization of the algorithm, which push the limits of contemporary research in automated image registration, especially for MMI algorithms. The WFMI algorithm contributes a novel extension of mutual information based correspondence methods through application to complex scenarios with illumination variations, parallax disparity, and occlusion disparity between multiple views.

While an affine homography is derived for certainly non-affine views, it is an accurate estimate and can very easily be used as a robust and intelligent set of initial conditions for point-to-point correspondence algorithms. This contribution of the WFMI algorithm could greatly reduce the mathematical and algorithmic complexity of the stronger techniques in the field of research, given that knowledge of the amount and general region of overlap between the views is also considered known in contemporary techniques. This could be used in a realtime system where the WFMI algorithm runs initially and is updated by a very simple feature-to-feature search in a small neighborhood, as it will be accurately assumed that corresponding features are nearby in the transformed view(s) presented by the WFMI algorithm.
