% BEGIN DOCUMENT

With a robust understanding of the foundational mathematics and concepts, the discussion of the algorithm focuses on understanding the practicalities that molded the application of the theory. Limitations and the success of the results will be discussed in Chapter 5 with the results themselves. The first section of this chapter will break down the major components of the algorithm into subsections, focusing on the implementation details while drawing from the foundational mathematics discussed in the previous chapter. The second section will then take a ``big picture'' overview of the algorithm, discussing how the components from those previous subsections all come together to form the fully functional algorithm. This allows a first-time reader to work from the nuts-and-bolts up to the big picture, while also providing a researcher the opportunity to skip to section 2 for a review of the algorithm and its applied models. This chapter will also discuss the process of the actual implementation of the algorithm in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and OpenCV alongside the details of the implementation.
