% ABSTRACT
%\begin{frame}[c]{Abstract}
%\noindent
%%\input{../LaTeX_Thesis/TommyKeane_MS_Thesis_Abstract.tex}
%{\tiny This algorithm performs automatic registration by foregoing any scene knowledge, requiring only modest scene overlap and an acceptable amount of entropy within each overlapping view. The weighted and filtered mutual information (WFMI) algorithm has been developed for stationary, color, surveillance video cameras. This is a novel extension of maximization of mutual information (MMI) algorithms, which are typically applied to scenes with simple shapes and near-affine relationships between views. The WFMI algorithm has been designed for realistic, complex scenes with occlusion and parallax variations between the views. And despite the typically non-affine related surveillance scenarios, the WFMI algorithm is searching only in the affine space for computational efficiency. The WFMI algorithm can perfectly register affine views, performs exceptionally well with near-affine related views, and in complex (projective or polynomial related) views the WFMI algorithm provides an accurate estimate of the overlap region between the views. The WFMI algorithm uses simple calculations (vector field gradient, Laplacian filtering, and feature histograms) to generate the WFMI metric and provide the optimal affine relationship. This work has been applied to individual video frames and future work could extend the algorithm into utilizing motion information or temporal frame registrations to enhance the results.}
