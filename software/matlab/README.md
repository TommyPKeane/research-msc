## MATLAB Version

This code was originally developed between 2009 and 2010, using [MATLAB R2009b](https://blogs.mathworks.com/community/2009/09/07/new-and-updated-desktop-features-in-matlab-r2009b/).

This is the final version of the MATLAB Algorithm from December 2010.

## Entrypoint(s)

As research code, and arguably my first major software development project (prior to most of my professional Software Engineering experience), this directory is a bit of a mess of various MATLAB modules with minimal documentation.

To run the "Weighted and Filtered Mutual Information (WFMI)" Algorithm the process would be to use the `RUN_PhaseI.m` module as a MATLAB script and call the function without any arguments -- this is considered as "Phase I".

This second stage ("Phase II") was being investigated as part of the prototype research, but was not part of the novel algorithm delivered as the Intellectual Property of this Thesis, so it has been removed from this most recent version of the codebase. You can search through the commit history of this repository if you want to review the older prototype code.
