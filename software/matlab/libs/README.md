## Color Image Segmentation

The `SegmentOverlap.m` and `SegmentOverlapMAP.m` files are the interfaces to the Color Image Segmentation Algorithm from the RIT Electrical Engineering Thesis Research: "Two and three dimensional segmentation of multimodal imagery" https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/2959/", but the source code has been removed.

⚠️ The source code for this Algorithm has been redacted, here, due to licensing restrictions. If you are interested in the algorithm, please reach out to the authors _via_ the RIT Thesis link above.
