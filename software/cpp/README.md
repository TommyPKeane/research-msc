## C++ Version

This code was originally developed in the Summer of 2010 and then partially refactored for testing and validation purposes in the Fall of 2010.

This code depends on `C++03` and an early version of [`OpenCV v2.1`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.1/) from April 2010.

## Code Styling

This code was developed on Windows XP using Tabs (`\t`) instead of Spaces and is formatted best at `4` spaces per tab.
